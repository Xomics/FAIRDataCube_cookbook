Welcome to the FAIR Data Cube cookbook!
===================================
The FAIR Data Cube (FDCube) is an important infrastructure component in the Netherlands X-omics initiative to make -omics data FAIR at the source, facilitate the reuse of -omics data, and facilitate the integration of different layers of -omics data

**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
