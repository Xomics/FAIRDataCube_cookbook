.. _FAIR Workflows:

What are FAIR Workflows?
------------

We define FAIR workflows as computational workflows that follow the FAIR4RS principles (add ref). 
Also, practical redommendations on the development of FAIR worklows are previously decribed by experienced workflow developers within the X-omics initiative (add ref).
Downstream of the FAIR Data Cube, we envision the use of FAIR workflows in the federated analyses.
